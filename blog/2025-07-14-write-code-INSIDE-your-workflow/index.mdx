As developers, we endure this torture every day. A simple regular expression can handle data cleaning, but the tool only provides basic filtering. I want to insert an API call into the process, but I find that the tool only allows the use of preset integration services. When encountering special file format processing, I can only watch the process get stuck.

This feeling of powerlessness of "seeing the needs but not reaching the solution" is like giving you a Swiss Army knife but welding the most important blade.

In oomol studio, we redefined the interaction method of workflow tools to make it truly understand the working habits of programmers. Imagine that when you are building a data processing process, you suddenly find that you need to add a special data conversion step-at this time you can directly insert a code editor window. This code block naturally integrates into the whole process like a Lego block, and is on par with other visual nodes.

The process of writing code is as smooth as in a familiar IDE. You can use Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript to write code. In oomol studio, dependency management uses a containerized solution to ensure stability. When you need to use a third-party library, you can ensure that the version and behavior of the third-party library remain consistent when the workflow runs on any machine. There is no need for users to manually handle virtual environments or package installations, and common libraries are available out of the box.

In the video, I fully demonstrate how to quickly build a custom image processing pipeline with code slots.
