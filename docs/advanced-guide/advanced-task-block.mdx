# Task Block Advanced Usage

## View Source Code

After converting a Scriptlet Block to a Task Block, the code will be hidden, but the code file itself still exists.

You can click the `Task Block Code` option in the Node menu to open the source code:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/task-block-show-source-code-in-flow.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/task-block-show-source-code-in-flow.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

For local Task Blocks, you can also view the source code through the settings button or the code button in the settings page:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/task-block-show-source-code-local.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/task-block-show-source-code-local.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

For local Task Blocks, you can edit the source code; otherwise, the source code is read-only.

## Custom Rendering

:::warning[Experimental]
This experimental feature is still under development. While we will continue to improve the user experience in future versions, please note that newer versions of OOMOL Studio may not be compatible with custom rendering code from previous versions. If you encounter issues with custom rendering after upgrading OOMOL Studio, please rewrite your custom rendering code according to the version update logs.
:::

:::info
Using custom rendering requires some [React](https://react.dev/) frontend technology foundation.
:::

Task Block Nodes have a `Configure Shared Block` menu item. Click it to enter the shared Block configuration.

You can also directly click the settings in the left shared Block panel to enter the configuration.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-enter-config.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-enter-config.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

The Task Block configuration is consistent with [Universal Block Settings](/docs/advanced-guide/universal-block-settings) except for the `Custom UI`.

Since the [Node.js preview](/docs/workflow-engine/nodejs-sdk-api#contextpreview-types) / [Python preview](/docs/workflow-engine/nodejs-sdk-api#contextpreview-types) functionality provided by OOMOL Studio has limited scenarios, we provide custom UI to let users decide what content the Block can render or preview.

After clicking the `Create` button under `Custom UI` in the Block configuration panel, wait for a moment, and OOMOL Studio will automatically initialize a set of UI template code.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

You can find the template code folder in the file explorer on the left, and the code entry file will appear under the `Custom UI` configuration item.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-files.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-files.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

### Code Development

In the automatically generated code, you can find a `src` folder, which contains the custom UI code.

The custom UI code editing entry is in `oo-render/src/render.tsx`. We can see that the custom UI obtains external properties by listening to `message` events:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-render-tsx.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-render-tsx.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

So we can call the `context.send_message()` method in the **Block code** to send data to the custom UI:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-send-message.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-send-message.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Here we sent a string with the input content.

Then we can edit the code in `oo-render/src/App.tsx`. Here we replace the code that directly prints data with a button that will show an alert with the data when clicked:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-code.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-code.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Then enter the custom UI directory in the terminal:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-enter-oo-render.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-enter-oo-render.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Run

```shell
pnpm build
```

to build the code.

Then re-run the Block, and you can see the custom UI style:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-run-in-block.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-run-in-block.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Clicking the button will show the content sent by the Block code:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-alert.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-alert.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

### Local Debugging

During the development of custom UI, we can debug the UI separately without re-running the Block each time, which can improve our development efficiency.

In the automatically generated code, you can find a `dev` folder, which contains content for local debugging of the custom UI.

First, we enter the custom UI directory:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-enter-oo-render.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-enter-oo-render.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Then execute in the terminal:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This will open a debug window in your local browser where you can see the custom UI preview:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-local-dev.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-local-dev.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="360"
/>

When we modify the custom UI code and save it, we can see the changes in real-time in this debug window without running the Block.

:::info
The styles running in the debug window may not be consistent with those running in OOMOL Studio, but this won't affect functionality. This is because VSCode registers stylesheets globally, while the browser environment doesn't have these stylesheets.
Therefore, the custom UI styles should be based on what's displayed in OOMOL Studio.
:::

You can simulate the content sent by the Block through the `context.send_message()` method at runtime in the `dev/dev.main.tsx` file.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-fake-data.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-fake-data.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

This way you can perform functional testing in the debug window:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-dev-run.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/shared-block-custom-UI-dev-run.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>
