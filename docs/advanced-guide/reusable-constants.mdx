# Reusable Constants

You can find the Value Block in the System Block Package.

The Value Block is a special built-in Shared Block in OOMOL Studio, designed to provide users with a reusable constant input box.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/value-block.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/value-block.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Here, the Value Block's function is equivalent to filling the input of two Python Blocks with the same value.

The Value Block itself is not an executable Block, so its output will not trigger the execution of downstream Nodes.

For Flows, the Value Block Node will not be the starting Node of the Flow; it merely has an assignment function.

Therefore, we use special connections to represent this mechanism.
