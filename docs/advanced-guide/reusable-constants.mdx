## Value Block

You can find the Value Block in the System Block Package.

The Value Block is a special built-in Shared Block in OOMOL Studio, designed to provide users with a reusable constant input box.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/value-block.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/value-block.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Here, the Value Block's function is equivalent to filling the input of two Python Blocks with the same value.
