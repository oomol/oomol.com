# Universal Block Settings

This article will describe in detail the common settings and usage methods shared by all Blocks.

## Node Menu

When a Block is used within a workflow, it is referenced as a Node in the workflow, and the Block will display a Node menu.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-menu.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-menu.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

### Execution

There are two execution methods in the Node menu. Users can choose whether to use the cache from the previous run. Both methods will start the workflow and run up to the current Node.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-run-button.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-run-button.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

The difference is whether to use the results from the previous Node execution as input for downstream Nodes.

#### Cache Mechanism

Considering that Blocks may execute high resource-consuming or very time-consuming tasks, users may not want to repeat these tasks. Therefore, we designed a Node caching mechanism.

After any Node executes successfully, except for Handles of type [variable](/docs/advanced-guide/universal-block-settings#variable), all Node output Handles will retain the output values from the previous execution. This way, when downstream Nodes choose to execute, they will automatically use cached values without triggering upstream Node execution.

Users can also choose "Clear cache and execute", which will make the current run not use cache, trigger upstream Node execution, and get the latest output values.

:::info
If the current Node's upstream output Handle has variable types, running will always trigger upstream Node execution regardless, because we cannot cache variables in the code execution environment.
:::

### Duplicate

Duplicate the current Node within the workflow. You can also use shortcuts `ctrl + c`(Windows) / `cmd + c`(MacOS) to copy, `ctrl + v`(Windows) / `cmd + v`(MacOS) to paste.

Using shortcuts allows copying and pasting across different workflows.

Duplicate behavior differs for scriptlet Blocks and shared Blocks:

- Scriptlet Blocks

  Duplicating will create a new Block in the workflow, including the Block's configuration files and code, resulting in two independent scriptlet Blocks that don't affect each other.

- Shared Blocks

  Duplicating only creates a reference to the shared Block in the workflow as a new Node. Both Nodes point to the same Block with the same code, so [configuring](/docs/advanced-guide/universal-block-settings#block-configuration) the shared Block will affect both Nodes simultaneously.

### Node Settings

Node Settings only takes effect within the current workflow. Each Node's settings is independent and doesn't affect other Nodes.

#### Metadata

For icons and titles, you can configure them in the menu or in the Node header. Double-click the title to enter a new title.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-base-config.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-base-config.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Node ID should be unique within the current workflow.

Node description can be entered in the configuration menu, or you can select the Node and double-click "Add description" below to enter the Node description.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-config-description.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-config-description.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

#### Timeout

Used to limit the maximum runtime of the current Node. If not set, there is no timeout by default.

### Ignore

Click "Ignore this Node" to set the Node to ignore status. When running the current flow, this Node and subsequent Nodes will be skipped.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-ignore.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-ignore.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

The ignore function can be used to debug workflow execution under different execution paths, for example:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-ignore-flow.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-ignore-flow.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Users can toggle the ignore status of Nodes to restrict the workflow to run under certain conditions.

### Delete

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-delete.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/node-delete.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

The delete function can remove the current Node. You can use the menu button or shortcut `ctrl + shift + delete`(Windows) / `cmd + shift + delete`(MacOS). This function has different behavioral logic for scriptlet Blocks and shared Blocks:

- Scriptlet Blocks

Will delete the Node and the scriptlet Block, including Block configuration and code files.

- Shared Blocks

Will only delete the Node within the workflow; the shared Block itself will not be deleted.

## Block Configuration

Since scriptlet Blocks can only be created and used within workflows, scriptlet Blocks have both Node and Block attributes, causing the Node configuration and Block configuration of scriptlets to be merged together.

Block configuration has different entry points for scriptlet Blocks and shared Blocks, but the effects are the same.

Universal Block configuration includes executor and Handle configuration.

### Executor

The executor is the runtime engine that loads and executes Block code. It acts as the bridge between OOMOL's workflow orchestration system and the actual code execution environment.

Each code language environment has a corresponding executor implementation. When configuring a Block, you specify which executor to use and how it should invoke your code.

For a comprehensive understanding of executors, see [Executor Concepts](/docs/concepts/executor).

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-config-executor.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-config-executor.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

#### Name

Currently, executors are implemented internally by the oomol team and support Python and Node.js runtime environments, so there are two corresponding options.

**Python Executor:**
- Executes Python code in a Python runtime environment
- Default entry function name: `main`
- Supports standard Python libraries and packages installed via Poetry
- Can pass complex Python objects (DataFrame, pandas instances, etc.) using [Variable type Handles](#variable)

**Node.js Executor:**
- Executes JavaScript/TypeScript code in a Node.js runtime environment
- Default entry function name: `default export function`
- Supports npm packages with full TypeScript support
- Can pass complex JavaScript objects using [Variable type Handles](#variable)

#### Entry

Select the code entry file. The default file is generated when users create scriptlet Blocks. If there are no special requirements, no changes are needed. Users can also specify any file, but must ensure implementation according to the code template, otherwise it won't run properly.

**Important considerations:**

- The entry file must implement the required function signature with two parameters:
  1. Input parameters (dictionary/object containing Handle values)
  2. Context object (providing runtime utilities)
- The function must return output values as a dictionary/object
- For async operations in Node.js, return a Promise

Refer to [Node.js template](/docs/workflow-engine/nodejs-sdk-api#scriptlet-template) and [Python template](/docs/workflow-engine/python-sdk-api#scriptlet-template) for implementation details.

#### Function

Specify the code entry method name. Default is the main method of the entry file (Python code) or default export function (Node.js code). You can specify custom methods if needed, but must include method parameters from the template code.

**Custom function example:**

For Python:
```python
def custom_function_name(params: dict, context: Context):
    # Your implementation
    return {"output": result}
```

For Node.js:
```typescript
export async function customFunctionName(params, context) {
    // Your implementation
    return { output: result };
}
```

#### Spawn

The Spawn setting controls whether a Block runs in an independent process or shares a process with adjacent Blocks.

**Automatic Optimization:**

When oomol studio runs workflows, it performs automatic detection. If upstream and downstream Blocks meet the following conditions, the internal scheduler will place both Block codes in the same process for invocation:

1. Implemented in the same code language (both Python or both Node.js)
2. For shared Blocks, they must also belong to the same package

**Benefits of same-process execution:**

1. **Resource efficiency**: Reduces memory overhead and eliminates process startup time
2. **Direct variable passing**: Upstream and downstream Blocks can pass code variables directly using [Variable type Handles](#variable), eliminating serialization and deserialization steps
3. **Performance improvement**: Eliminates inter-process communication overhead

**When to enable Spawn (independent process):**

You may want to manually enable independent process execution in these scenarios:

- **Isolation**: The Block contains potentially unstable code that might crash
- **Memory management**: The Block performs memory-intensive operations that should be isolated
- **Resource limits**: You need strict resource limits for this specific Block
- **Debugging**: You want to debug this Block in isolation from others
- **Concurrency**: The Block uses threading or async operations that might interfere with other Blocks

**Performance implications:**

- **Same process**: Fastest execution, can use Variable Handles, shared memory
- **Independent process**: Slight performance overhead for process creation and inter-process communication, but better isolation and stability

:::tip
In most cases, you can rely on OOMOL's automatic optimization. Only enable Spawn if you have specific requirements for isolation or resource management.

For more details on how executors manage processes and data transfer, see [Executor Concepts - Process Management](/docs/concepts/executor#process-management).

### Handle Configuration

Handle configuration is divided into input Handles and output Handles configuration. Output Handles have the same configuration items as input configuration except they cannot specify Handle values.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

#### Handle

The name of the input or output Handle. Users can specify custom names. When the name is modified, the corresponding input or output parameter types in the code will also be automatically updated.

#### Nullable

Configure whether this Handle allows passing `null` (Node.js code) / `None` (Python code) as values. This option is mainly used to restrict input or output types.

This option affects automatically generated types in code and upstream-downstream connection behavior.

If upstream allows outputting `null` / `None` values but downstream doesn't allow it, the connection will error.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-null.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-null.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

#### Custom Type Name

Used for users to customize Handle connection validation rules. If users set this value, all other Handle connecting to this Handle must set the same value, otherwise the connection will fail.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-custom-type.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-custom-type.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

#### Description

Handle descriptions are not displayed and can only be seen in Handle settings.

#### Preset Type

Handle can be configured with preset types to restrict connectable Handles and automatically generate configured types in code.

Selecting different types will change the preset type sub-configuration items and data input fields.

##### Any

The Handle has no restrictions and can connect to any other Handle.

After selecting `Any` type, the right data input field will have a data type button for selecting input value types, which doesn't affect Handle type restrictions.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-any.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-any.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### String

Handle value is string type.

Sub-configuration items can configure string format. If a format is selected, rules can be added to values, or you can specify custom regular expressions.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-string.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-string.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Variable

Handle value is variable type.

For variable type Handles, the connected Handle must be the same language and variable type. If one side is a shared Block, the other side needs to be a Block from the same package.

After setting to variable type, the Handle can pass complex format code objects, such as `DataFrame` or `pandas` instances in Python.

In some scenarios where objects cannot be converted to strings or simple types, this method can be used for passing, and passing objects can eliminate serialization and deserialization steps, improving performance.

However, due to connection restrictions, variable type Handles may reduce Block universality, so use with caution.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-var.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-var.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Number

Handle value is number type.

Number type can be floating point or integer, any number type is allowed.

Sub-configuration items can set number range restrictions. In the Block's data control, buttons can adjust numerical values. The step size in sub-configuration items is used to configure the numerical increase or decrease per button click.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-number.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-number.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Path

Handle value is address string type, can connect to other string type Handles.

Sub-options include `directory` / `file` / `save as`. The `directory` / `file` options require the corresponding address to exist before selection in data controls, while `save as` option can create non-existent files or folders.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-path.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-path.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Secret

Handle value is encrypted string type, can connect to other string type Handles.

Considering users may use private strings like API Keys in certain scenarios, we provide secret functionality to prevent user sensitive information leakage.

Users can add secrets in the [secret management page](/docs/get-started/interface/home/#secrets-page) on the homepage or [secret management page within project interface](/docs/get-started/interface/project#keys).

Then they can select and use them in secret type Handles.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-secret.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-secret.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Boolean

Handle value is boolean type, only has `True` / `False` two values that can be set, can be toggled with a switch.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-bool.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-bool.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Integer

Handle value is integer number type.

Sub-configuration items are the same as number type, but cannot connect to number type Handles because number type might be floating point.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-int.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-int.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Color

Handle value is color format string type, can connect to other string type Handles.

After selecting color type, you can use color selection controls in the data input field. In sub-configuration items, we provide `HEX` / `HEX8` / `HSV` / `RGB` four color format options.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-color.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-color.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### TextArea

Handle value is string type, can connect to other string type Handles.

This type mainly facilitates users entering large text Blocks in data input fields, avoiding text folding that makes observation inconvenient.

Drag the button in the bottom right corner of the text box to change text box height.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-text.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-text.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Object

Handle value is object type.

For `Node.js`, equivalent to plain object; for `Python`, equivalent to dictionary object.

You can set the type of each object element for object type Handles. The plus and minus buttons on the right can add or delete sub-elements.

In sub-configuration items, there's an `additional properties` configuration, indicating whether the current Handle allows elements other than those specified in the Handle type. For example:

With `additional properties` enabled, if the Handle type is:

```
{
  field1: number,
  field2: string
}
```

Then passing the value:

```
{
  field1: 1,
  field2: "2",
  field3: {}
}
```

is allowed, and `field3` as an additional property has no type restrictions.

If `additional properties` is disabled, no additional properties are allowed.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-dict.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-dict.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Array

Handle value is array type.

For `Node.js`, equivalent to array object; for `Python`, equivalent to list object.

Selecting sub-type in the data input field or selecting `Item type` in sub-configuration items can constrain all array elements to the same type. If `No constraints` type is selected, each element in the array can be different types.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-array.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-array.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Select

If single select, Handle value is enumerated string type; if multi-select, it's an array type with string type items.

When using select type, you need to configure preset options in sub-configuration items first, then selectable content will appear in the data input field.

> Single Select

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-single-select.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-single-select.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

> Multi-Select

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-multi-select.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-multi-select.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Date

Handle value is date format string.

Date format is 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'

Sub-configuration items can select `date` / `time` / `date-time`, corresponding to date only, time only, and date plus time respectively. Different options will cause changes in the selection Handle.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-date.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-date.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Binary

Handle value is binary type.

Although this type of value can be serialized, it cannot be meaningfully displayed, so there's no corresponding representation and configuration in the Handle. This type of Handle can only be connected and cannot set values through data input fields.

Can be used for special scenarios, such as upstream reading a file and passing it to downstream, or upstream outputting memory data to downstream. Downstream decides whether to serialize the binary or store it as a file.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-binary.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-binary.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Null

Handle value is fixed as null(for Node.js) / None(for Python) value.

After type selection, no other type values can be set, generally used for debugging and other special scenarios.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-null.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-null.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### Applicators

Handle value needs to meet set applicator conditions.

Currently supported applicator is `Any one`, meaning Handle value only needs to meet any one of the conditions.

After selecting applicator, you need to configure conditions to be met in sub-configuration items. For example:

Configure condition 1 type as number, condition 2 type as string, then input values that are numbers or strings are both legal.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-combine.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-combine.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

##### LLM

A special Handle type providing two sub-options: `model` / `message`.

This Handle type provides users with a series of parameters convenient for using AI models in code.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-LLM.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-LLM.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

When selecting `model`, the input Handle will be converted to an AI model selection Handle. This Handle cannot be connected, and input values are fixed to user-selected and configured model parameters.

After selecting `model`, you can see the output Handle type changes. Users can now get model parameters configured in the Handle through the input Handle.

:::info
Users still need to create model invocation clients themselves to integrate AI in code. This Handle only provides configurable parameters to allow Blocks to modify parameters through the Handle during use and take effect, avoiding code modification.
:::

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-LLM-model.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-LLM-model.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

When selecting `message`, the input Handle will be converted to AI prompt input. This Handle cannot be connected.

After selecting `message`, you can see the output Handle type changes. Users can now get prompt parameters configured in the Handle through the input Handle.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-LLM-message.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-LLM-message.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Users can configure multiple prompts on input Handles.

When users want to change LLM type input Handles back to normal Handles, they need to select other types in the Handle configuration panel:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-LLM-return.png"
    ),

      "/img/docs/advanced-guide/advanced-block-usage/block-handle-config-type-LLM-return.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

#### JsonSchema

When users are not satisfied with Handle constraint conditions created on the page, they can edit the Handle's [JsonSchema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference) constraint file themselves. Click the toggle button in the upper right corner of the configuration panel:

<Image
