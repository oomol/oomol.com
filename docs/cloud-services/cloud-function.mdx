# Cloud Function

OOMOL Cloud Function is a serverless computing platform that allows you to deploy your OOMOL workflows as production-ready APIs without managing infrastructure. Focus on writing code, and let OOMOL handle the rest.

## Overview

OOMOL Cloud Function transforms your workflow blocks into scalable cloud services with just one click. You write the function blocks, and OOMOL takes care of deployment, scaling, and operations.

### Key Benefits

- **Painless Generation**: Deploy your workflows instantly without complex configurations
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for actual usage, no upfront server costs
- **Zero Maintenance**: No need to manage servers, environments, or scaling
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically handles traffic spikes and scaling

## Three Deployment Modes

### 1. Publish as Library

Share your blocks with the community or compose them into more complex workflows.

**Use Cases:**
- Share reusable components with other developers
- Build modular functionality that others can extend
- Create building blocks for community innovation

**How it Works:**
- Package your blocks with clear inputs and outputs
- Publish to the OOMOL community library
- Others can discover and use your blocks in their workflows

### 2. Deploy as Cloud Function

One-click deployment to serverless infrastructure with automatic scaling.

**Use Cases:**
- Create REST API endpoints for your applications
- Build backend services without managing servers
- Provide stable, production-ready APIs to users

**Features:**
- Automatic HTTPS endpoints
- Built-in load balancing
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automatic scaling based on demand

**Example:**
```bash
# Your workflow automatically gets a public API endpoint
https://api.oomol.com/v1/your-function-id
```

### 3. Provide for AI (MCP)

Publish your functions via Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI agents to use.

**Use Cases:**
- Let AI assistants call your functions directly
- Create tools that AI agents can discover and use
- Connect your code to the intelligent world

**How it Works:**
- Your function is exposed via MCP protocol
- AI agents can discover and call your function
- Seamless integration with Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI assistants

## Pricing

OOMOL Cloud Function uses a simple pay-per-use pricing model:

- **No fixed costs**: No monthly server fees or upfront payments
- **Usage-based billing**: Pay only for actual function invocations
- **Transparent pricing**: Clear pricing per API call
- **Free tier available**: Get started with generous free usage limits

Visit [OOMOL Console](https://console.oomol.com/cloud-function) for detailed pricing information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An OOMOL account
- OOMOL Studio installed on your computer
- A workflow ready to deploy

### Deployment Steps

1. **Create Your Workflow**
   - Build your workflow in OOMOL Studio
   - Test it locally to ensure it works correctly
   - Define clear input and output parameters

2. **Configure Deployment**
   - Open the deployment panel in OOMOL Studio
   - Select "Cloud Function" as deployment target
   - Configure function settings (timeout, memory, etc.)

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy to Cloud"
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Get your function's API endpoint

4. **Test Your Function**
   - Use the provided endpoint to test your function
   - Monitor usage and performance in OOMOL Console
   - Share the API with your users

### Example Deployment

Here's a simple example of calling a deployed cloud function:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.oomol.com/v1/your-function-id \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": "your data"}'
```

## Management

### OOMOL Console

Access [OOMOL Console](https://console.oomol.com/cloud-function) to:

- View all your deployed functions
- Monitor usage and performance metrics
- Manage API keys and access control
- Check billing and usage statistics
- Update function configurations
- View logs and debugging information

### Monitoring

- **Real-time metrics**: Track invocations, latency, and errors
- **Usage analytics**: Understand how your functions are being used
- **Error tracking**: Quickly identify and fix issues
- **Performance insights**: Optimize function execution time

## Best Practices

### Function Design

1. **Keep functions focused**: Each function should do one thing well
2. **Define clear interfaces**: Document input and output parameters
3. **Handle errors gracefully**: Return meaningful error messages
4. **Optimize for cold starts**: Minimize initialization time

### Security

1. **Use API keys**: Protect your functions with authentication
2. **Validate inputs**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
3. **Set rate limits**: Prevent abuse with appropriate rate limiting
4. **Monitor usage**: Watch for unusual patterns or potential attacks

### Performance

1. **Optimize dependencies**: Only include necessary libraries
2. **Cache when possible**: Reduce redundant computations
3. **Use appropriate timeouts**: Set realistic execution time limits
4. **Test at scale**: Verify performance under expected load

## Comparison with Traditional Deployment

| Feature | Traditional Server | OOMOL Cloud Function |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Setup Time** | Hours to days | Minutes |
| **Server Management** | Required | None |
| **Scaling** | Manual | Automatic |
| **Costs** | Fixed monthly fees | Pay per use |
| **Maintenance** | Ongoing | Handled by OOMOL |
| **SSL/HTTPS** | Manual setup | Built-in |
| **Deployment** | Complex | One-click |

## Use Cases

### API Services
Build RESTful APIs for mobile apps, web applications, or third-party integrations.

### Data Processing
Process files, transform data, or perform batch operations on-demand.

### Integrations
Connect different services and automate workflows between them.

### AI Tools
Create specialized tools that AI assistants can call to extend their capabilities.

### Webhooks
Respond to events from external services like GitHub, Stripe, or Slack.
