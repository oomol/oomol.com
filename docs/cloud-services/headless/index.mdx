# Headless

A standalone headless studio for local deployment (typically on NAS), without Electron or server-side scheduling.

## Local Development

1. Prepare the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   OOMOL_ENV=prod
   OOMOL_TOKEN=  # Optional, for connecting to OOMOL services https://console.oomol.com/api-key
   START_API_SERVER=true
   START_UI_SERVER=true
   OOMOL_LOCAL=1
   ENABLE_OOMOL_CONNECT=true  # Recommended, enables remote operations
   ```

2. Build with `pnpm build`
3. Run with `pnpm start`

## Docker Deployment

1. Prepare the storage directory, for example:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p $HOME/oomol-storage
   ```

2. Prepare the environment variables file:

   Place `.env` in `$HOME/.oomol-studio/headless/.env` with the following content (note: remove `OOMOL_LOCAL=1`):

   ```bash
   OOMOL_ENV=prod
   OOMOL_TOKEN=  # Optional, for connecting to OOMOL services
   START_API_SERVER=true
   START_UI_SERVER=true
   ENABLE_OOMOL_CONNECT=true  # Recommended, enables remote operations
   ```

3. Pull and run the Docker image, binding the storage directory and environment variables file:

   ```bash
   docker pull oomolstudio/headless:latest

   docker run -d --privileged --name oomol-headless -p 4000:4000 -p 52222:52222 --mount type=bind,src=$HOME/.oomol-studio/headless/.env,dst=/app/.env --mount type=bind,src=$HOME/oomol-storage,dst=/oomol-driver/oomol-storage oomolstudio/headless:latest
   ```

4. Access the UI at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Environment Variables

### ENABLE_OOMOL_CONNECT

**Recommended configuration**: `ENABLE_OOMOL_CONNECT=true`

When enabled, you can remotely operate your Headless instance through [connect.oomol.com](https://connect.oomol.com), including:

- Remote function calls
- Remote package installation
- Remote workflow management

**We highly recommend enabling this option** as it significantly improves your user experience.
