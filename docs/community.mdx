# Community

In the `Community` section of the application homepage, you can find all packages [published online by everyone](/docs/get-started/export-and-publish#online-publishing).

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-page.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-page.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

After clicking on any package, you can view the detailed information of the package.

The content includes a preview of the flows in the package, package documentation, description, version information, etc.

Depending on the publishing method of the package, the open button here will be different.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-detail.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-detail.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Clicking the button will open the project locally. If it's a package [published as a template](/docs/get-started/export-and-publish#publish-as-template), it will contain all project details after opening, and you can perform secondary development based on it. Otherwise, the project will only contain flows.

## Github Publisher

In actual engineering development, a more common way to update and publish is to publish automatically after code updates.

OOMOL Studio supports configuring Github Actions to monitor code changes and automatically trigger publishing behavior when code changes occur.

    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-publisher.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-publisher.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-publisher-config.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-publisher-config.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

The Github repository is your repository name. After configuring the publisher, everyone will see that the publisher is this user after the package is published.

You need to configure the relevant Actions in your Github repository. For configuration, you can refer to the [example project](https://github.com/oomol-lab/oopm-publish-action).

## Collaboration

:::info
This is a feature that can only be used by standard subscription users. You can enter [OOMOL Console](https://console.oomol.com/) through the button at the bottom left of the application homepage. Then modify your subscription plan in the Console.

By default, if you have already published a package, only you can publish new versions of that package.

If you need to allow other users to have publishing permissions, you can invite other users to become maintainers.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-maintainer.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-maintainer.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

After clicking the `Invite` button, you can search for users and generate an invitation link. Send the invitation link to the specified user to let them accept becoming a maintainer.

    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-maintainer-invite.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/community/community-maintainer-invite.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

:::info
All maintainers have the same permissions. Please make sure you invite the correct users.
