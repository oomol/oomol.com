# Flow

A Flow is a specific implementation of a business purpose.

After creating a project, you can start implementing your business purpose.

## Creation

After you create a project, OOMOL Studio will create a default Flow for you. You can also create a new Flow through the create button in the left Flow panel.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/create-flow.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/create-flow.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

After selecting a Flow, you can see that the central panel enters the Flow editing window.

## Editing

A Flow itself is composed of one or more [Nodes](/docs/concepts/node). You can find various [Blocks](/docs/concepts/block) from the right Block panel, and after adding them to the Flow, they become Nodes of the Flow.

A Flow must have at least one Node to be meaningful. Here we add two Nodes to the Flow: one for creating an email client and one for sending emails. Then we connect the Nodes:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/new-flow.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/new-flow.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

This way, the Flow implements an email sending business, which is divided into two steps: first create an email client, then use the client to send emails.

## Execution

In OOMOL Studio, only Flows are executable concepts. We can run the entire Flow or run Nodes within the Flow:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/run-flow.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/run-flow.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

The execution order of a Flow follows the connections between Nodes. Before execution, OOMOL Studio performs a search to find Nodes with **unconnected input Handles** as the starting Nodes for execution. If there are multiple starting Nodes, all these starting Nodes will start running simultaneously.

Then Nodes are executed in the order of output Handle -> input Handle connections until completion.

There is a special case of wiring here. The wiring of the [Value Block](/docs/advanced-guide/reusable-constants) is only considered as assignment and will not affect the result of judging whether the Node is the start Node.
