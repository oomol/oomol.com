# Node

A Node is a Block that composes a Flow. It is the name for a Block in a specific usage environment.

When you place one or more Blocks in the Flow editor:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/flow-node.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/flow-node.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

These Blocks **in the Flow** are called Nodes. A Block itself can be seen as an encapsulated functionality, but it has no meaning and cannot be executed if it is not used in a specific working environment.

Therefore, Blocks in a Flow take on the functionality of a specific part of the business process, and at this point they become executable Nodes.

Except for script Nodes, editing Nodes in a Flow does not directly affect the properties and code of the Block itself. Each Node can be considered as a copy that references the Block, and does not affect the original Block definition.

:::info
Only script Blocks are special. Script Blocks, as a means to quickly start editing code, are created and used directly in the Flow, so they have both Node and Block configuration properties.

Editing the properties of a script Node is editing the Block itself, and each script Node is independent of each other.
