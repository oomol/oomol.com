# Package

Package is the name given to a project when it is released as a complete product.

When the Flows or Blocks you develop can be reused by other projects or users, you can choose to publish this content as a package.

Package is the name given to a project when it is released as a complete product. It contains one or more Flows and Blocks. You can use any individual content from the package separately, but downloading requires the entire package content.

You can find packages with different functionalities in the store page:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/package-store.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/package-store.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

After downloading a package, you can use the Blocks in the package to complete your business.

Or you can search for packages that meet your needs on the community page of the homepage. Packages opened this way can directly use the contained Flows:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/package-community.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/package-community.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/package-detail.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/package-detail.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

## Package Types

Packages have two publishing methods, corresponding to different usage scopes.

If the package you created only meets your own usage needs and you don't want to share it with others, you can choose to publish it locally.

If published to the cloud, then all OOMOL users can see and download this package:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/package-publish.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/package-publish.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>
