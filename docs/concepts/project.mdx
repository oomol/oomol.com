# Project

Project is the beginning of everything.

When you want to achieve a certain goal through code (such as sending an email to your friend), you can create a project and then achieve your purpose through your coding abilities or the work of others in the community.

You can create a project from scratch:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/create-project.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/create-project.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

Perhaps the community has already implemented what you want to do, and you can start directly from a community project:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/clone-project.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/clone-project.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

The difference is that projects opened from the community already contain workflows that can be run directly or slightly modified to achieve your desired purpose.

## Project Structure

Regardless of which way you create a project, you will enter the project editing page, and then you can see the file list in the lower left corner:

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/new-project.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/docs/concepts/new-project.png"),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

All files here are the specific content of the project. There must be a `package.oo.yaml` file in the root directory of the project, which is used to describe the version, initialization script and other information of the current project.

OOMOL Studio also determines whether the current folder belongs to an OOMOL project based on the `package.oo.yaml` file.

There are several OOMOL Studio-specific folders within the project:

### Flows

Used to store description files for [Flows](/docs/concepts/flow). A project can have multiple Flows, and each Flow will be stored separately in a folder named after the Flow name.

### tasks

Used to store files related to [task Blocks](/docs/concepts/block#task-block). A project can contain multiple task Blocks, and each task Block will be stored separately in a folder named after the Block name.

### subflows

Used to store files related to [subflow Blocks](/docs/concepts/block#subflow-block). A project can contain multiple subflow Blocks, and each subflow Block will be stored separately in a folder named after the Block name.

:::info
All your operations in the OOMOL Studio panel can basically be automatically saved to these files without manual modification.
Therefore, we do not recommend that you directly delete files in the project unless you know what you are doing, otherwise direct file operations may cause the application to crash.
