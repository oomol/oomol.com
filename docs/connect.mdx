# Connect Service

OOMOL Connect Service is an innovative solution that enables public internet access to OOMOL applications on your local devices without complex network configuration.

## Architecture Overview

```

### How It Works

1. **External Requests**: Users initiate requests via web, API, or MCP protocol
2. **Gateway Authentication**: OOMOL Gateway verifies the API Token in requests
3. **Reverse Proxy**: After verification, the gateway forwards requests to your device
4. **Local Processing**: Your OOMOL Studio or Headless instance processes the request
5. **Return Results**: Results are sent back through a secure channel

    package_name="your-package-name",
    params={
        "input": "your input data"
    }
)

print(result)
```
