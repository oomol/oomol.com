# Frequently Asked Questions

## Dependencies in script blocks of opened projects cannot be installed

### Problem

After opening a community project, users find that the flow uses script blocks, but during runtime, they discover that the modules required by the script blocks cannot be found.

### Cause

Suppose developers depend on third-party modules in script blocks within flows. In this case, if it's Node.js code, it would use a `package.json` file, and if it's Python code, it would use `requirements.txt` or similar files to lock the versions of third-party modules.

When users clone the flow to their local machine (the files that lock module versions must also be cloned, otherwise the code cannot be guaranteed to execute) and start using it, if the developer updates the dependency module versions at that time, users have only two choices to synchronize the updates:

1. Delete the local project, re-pull the developer's latest project, install everything, and then run it.

2. Check the developer's changes and perform the same operations locally.

Both choices are cumbersome for users, especially for users who don't understand code.

In another scenario, users might use the package as a foundation for secondary development. When users encounter version conflicts between modules they use in certain code and the original package's modules, it becomes impossible to handle.

Therefore, we choose to prohibit developers from using script blocks that depend on third-party modules in flows published online.

### Answer

**We recommend converting all script blocks to shared blocks before publishing, which can avoid the above problems.**

If you must use script blocks, please remember that you can only use built-in modules of the programming language.

## How to connect to services on the user's computer (MySQL, Redis, etc.) within OOMOL Studio

### Answer

OOMOL Studio application runs in a container environment, which is isolated from the user's computer.

However, you can access services on the computer through the special domain name `host.docker.internal` provided by the container.

Refer to [Docker container connecting to host services](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/networking/#i-want-to-connect-from-a-container-to-a-service-on-the-host).

For example:

If you start a MySQL service on your computer, you can connect through `http://127.0.0.1:3306` on the local machine. In OOMOL Studio, you can connect through `http://host.docker.internal:3306`.
