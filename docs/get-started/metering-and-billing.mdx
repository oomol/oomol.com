# Metering and Billing

OOMOL Studio has built-in LLM blocks that allow users to select and interact with various large language models integrated by OOMOL, without needing to write integration code.

OOMOL Studio application itself is free to use, but calling LLM blocks will incur corresponding service fees, which we convert to OOMOL Credits for deduction.

:::info
If you want to use your own large language model API Token, you can choose to write code through script blocks to integrate the model.

## OOMOL Credits

OOMOL Studio integrates various popular large language models currently available, and considering user costs, we have also selected different channels. Given that each channel has different billing methods, we uniformly settle the costs of using these AI services as OOMOL Credits.

Each month, OOMOL provides users with a certain amount of Credits quota. Users can log in to the [Console platform](https://console.oomol.com) to view Credits usage and balance.

You can also check Credits pricing on the [pricing page](/pricing).

If needed, you can purchase additional Credits on the Console platform, or change your subscription plan to get Credits purchase discounts.
