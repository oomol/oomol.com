# Merge into a Reusable Block

In the previous section, we created a exponentiation based on the adder and developed a Flow to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Now we want to convert this Flow into a reusable block so that it can be used in other Flows. Otherwise, we would need to recreate this Flow each time, which is clearly inconvenient.

## Convert to Subflow Block

 <ThemedComponent>
  {({theme}) => {
    const url = useBaseUrl(
      theme === "dark"
        ? "/img/docs/get-started/zero-to-one/merge-into-a-reusable-block-dark.mp4"
        : "/img/docs/get-started/zero-to-one/merge-into-a-reusable-block-light.mp4"
    );
    return (
      <video controls muted autoPlay loop style={{ width: "100%" }}>
        <source src={url} type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    )
  }}
</ThemedComponent>

As shown above, we have transformed the Flow from the previous section into a subflow block for reuse in other Flows. This greatly enhances the reusability of the Flow.
