# Overview

## Core Features

OOMOL is an AI-driven workflow platform designed for data analysis, automation script development, and intelligent agent construction. Compared to similar products, we focus more on open-source ecosystem and programmability.

### Open Source

Our business model: The underlying execution engine is completely open source, while the upper-level applications serve as value-added conveniences.

- Open-source underlying execution engine, making it easy for developers to understand our operating principles and customize functionality
- Support for exporting Docker images, enabling seamless cross-platform deployment (in development)

### Programmable

Our core is the Scriptlet Block, which allows developers to implement custom business logic using Python and Node.js.

- Traditional workflow products typically limit users to predefined modules, restricting business implementation
- We seamlessly integrate workflows with the vast open-source ecosystem, allowing direct use of various open-source libraries in workflows, giving the product unlimited possibilities

### AI Native

- Integrated AI-assisted programming capabilities to lower coding barriers
- Support for automated programming based on large model function calling
- Built-in variety of AI models that developers can use directly without complex configuration
