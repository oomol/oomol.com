# Scriptlet Block

All block content in OOMOL is converted from `Scriptlet Blocks`.

`Scriptlet Block` is a core fundamental module.

When built-in blocks cannot meet the needs of creating workflows, users can supplement them by programming based on `Scriptlet Blocks`.

## Usage

You can drag it out from the `System Blocks` toolbar on the right side and use it.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/scriptlet-use-light.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/scriptlet-use-dark.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

## Configuration

You can add or remove input/output interfaces, select input/output types, modify block names, and other operations.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/scriptlet-handle-setting-light.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/scriptlet-handle-setting-dark.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

## Code Editing

`Scriptlet Block` supports using Node.js and Python to handle business logic. It supports community open-source library references and AI-assisted programming.

The input/output interface names and types modified in the previous step will be automatically synchronized to the code.

:::info
Please do not delete the generated comments in the code:

```
#region generated meta
...
#endregion
```

These comments are used to automatically generate the names and type codes for input/output interfaces. Deleting them may cause the types in the code to not match the block settings. You can also choose to manually write the type code.
:::

Here we implement an adder with code. The function is to add the values of the two input interfaces input1 and input2, and output to the output interface.

You can click the button indicated in the image to open the code in a new tab, which can give you a better code editing experience.

    ),
  }}

## Run and Results

You can choose the two running methods shown in the image:

1. Start all blocks in the workflow
2. Start only the corresponding block

After starting, you can observe the running status and input/output content of all blocks in the log bar below.
