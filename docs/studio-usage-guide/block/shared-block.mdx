# Shared Block

`Shared Block` is a reusable block converted from `Scriptlet Block`.

When a `Scriptlet Block` has general functionality and developers want to abstract it into a tool for repeated use, they can convert the `Scriptlet Block` into a `Shared Block`.

## Generation

You can convert it to a `Shared Block` through the button in the upper right corner of the `Scriptlet Block`.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-generate.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-generate.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

You can also create a new `Shared Block` in the left toolbar.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-create.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-create.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

## Usage

The generated `Shared Block` will appear in the shared block bar on the left, and you can drag it out and use it.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-use.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-use.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

## Configuration

You can click on the shared block to configure input and output parameters. The interaction here is the same as with `Scriptlet Block`.

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-setting.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-setting.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

## Code Editing

`Shared Block` converted from `Scriptlet Block` will retain the original settings and code, but the code will be hidden.

You can view and edit the code through the following two block menus.

> Block menu in the workflow editor

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-code.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-code.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

> Block menu in the block toolbar

<Image
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-code2.png"
    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/img/docs/cn/studio-usage-guide/block/shared-block-code2.png"
    ),
  }}
  width="720"
/>

## Run and Results

You can choose the two running methods shown in the image:

1. Start all blocks in the workflow
2. Start only the corresponding block

After starting, you can observe the running status and input/output content of all blocks in the log bar below.
