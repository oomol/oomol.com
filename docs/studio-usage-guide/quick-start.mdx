# ðŸš€ Quick Start

Follow the document from download to launching your first workflow.

## 1. Download

Download the latest version of `OOMOL STUDIO` from the [landing page](https://oomol.com);

## 2. Installation

1. Mac can be installed and used directly.
2. Windows needs to follow the installation guide to start [wsl2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrZolfGm8Zk) and restart before it can run.

## 3. Login by Github

We hope users will push the workflow source code on github, so we first supported github login.

## 4. Launch from Community

You can find a workflow you need in the community, and click the button to open by `OOMOL STUDIO`.
