# ðŸ’¡ Scriptlet & Shared Block


## 1. Scriptlet Block

Scriptlet Block is a core basic module. All block content in OOMOL is converted from Scriptlet Block. 

When the built-in blocks cannot meet the needs of creating workflows, users can supplement based on Scriptlet Block programming.

### 1.1 Use Scriptlet Block

> You can drag it out from the Scriptlet Block toolbar on the left and use it.

<img src={scriptlet} width="720" />

### 1.2 Configure Scriptlet Block

> Add or delete input output parameters, and define the type.

<img src={scriptlet_config} width="720" />

### 1.3 Scriptlet Block Code

> Support the use of Nodejs and Python to process business logic. Support the reference to open-source libraries of the community, support the completion and AI assisted programming.

### 1.4 Scriptlet Block Preview

> This function is to help developers preview data. We support the preview of almost all commonly used data.

## 2. Shared Block

Shared Block is converted from Scriptlet Block and is also an important basic module. When the function of a Scriptlet Block is universal, and developers want to abstract it into a tool for repeated use, you can convert the Scriptlet Block into a Shared Block.

### 2.1 Generate Shared Block

> You can convert a Scriptlet Block into a Shared Block using the button in the upper right corner of the Scriptlet Block.

<img src={scriptlet_to_block} width="720" />

> You can also create a Shared Block from the left toolbar.

<img src={create_block} width="720" />

### 2.2 Use Shared Block

> You can drag it out from the Shared Block toolbar on the left and use it.

<img src={block} width="720" />

### 2.3 Configure Shared Block

> You can click Shared Block to configure input and output parameters.
> The interaction here is the same as Scriptlet Block.

### 2.4 Shared Block Code

> You can click the code icon of the Shared Block to change its code
