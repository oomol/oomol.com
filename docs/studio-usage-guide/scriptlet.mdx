# ðŸ“¦ Scriptlet and Block

## Scriptlet

Scriptlet is a core basic module. When the built-in block cannot meet the needs of creating workflows, users can supplement based on Scriptlet programming.

<img src={scriptlet} width="720" />

## Block

Block is converted from Scriptlet and is also an important basic module. When the function of a Scriptlet is universal and developers want to abstract it into a tool for repeated use, you can convert the Scriptlet into a Block.

<img src={block} width="720" />
