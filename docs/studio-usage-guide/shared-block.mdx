# ðŸ“¦ Shared Block

Shared Block is converted from Scriptlet Block and is also an important basic module. When the function of a Scriptlet Block is universal and developers want to abstract it into a tool for repeated use, you can convert the Scriptlet Block into a Shared Block.

## 1. Use Shared Block

> You can drag it out from the Shared Block toolbar on the left and use it.

<img src={block} width="720" />

## 2. Configure Shared Block

> You can click Shared Block to configure input and output parameters.
> The interaction here is the same as Scriptlet Block.

<img src={block_edit} width="720" />

## 3. Shared Block Code

> You can click the code icon of the Shared Block to change its code

<img src={block_code} width="720" />
