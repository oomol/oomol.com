# OOMOL Studio

## General

### Support adding handles automatically when connecting

In previous versions, every time a new connection line was created, it required re-entering the name and type, which affected the overall user experience. Now, we support the automatic generation of these keys when you drag a new connection line, making the operation smoother!

### Support Subflow

We've received a lot of feedback from users. Previously, we only supported reuse at the Block level. However, workflows can be very complex, and only supporting Block-level reuse can significantly increase maintenance costs later. Therefore, we've introduced `subflow`! This feature allows you to encapsulate a Flow into a Block, making it easy to reuse Flow functionalities and reducing the display area on the diagram.

### Support Batch Processing

We found that some developers frequently encounter the need to modify existing workflows to support multiple tasks when using OOMOL Studio. For example, a workflow that originally processes a single image might need significant changes to handle multiple images simultaneously. To address this, we've added a batch processing feature that allows data to be traversed using a method similar to the Map function, enabling single-instance processing modules to convert into batch processing modules.

### Support Network Proxy

We've noticed that some users heavily rely on proxies to access certain online resources. Therefore, we've added network proxy functionality!

### Default Python Library Installation Changed from pip to poetry

We've observed that pip is not particularly reliable for version locking of dependencies, so we have replaced it with poetry to avoid issues due to library version changes.
