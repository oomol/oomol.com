# OOMOL Studio

## General

### 1. Support Exporting Images

In this version, we have added the ability to export images. You can export certain workflows to a Docker(Podman) image for self-deployment and execution.

Export image API documentation: [Export Image]

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/release/1.3.0/home-export.png")}
  alt="Export Image in Home Page"
/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/release/1.3.0/export-options.png")}
  alt="Export Image Options in Home Page"
/>

### 2. New Markdown Comment Block

We received feedback from some users that it was quite difficult to add additional explanations or comments in workflows. Therefore, we have added a _comment block_ to allow workflow authors to easily and flexibly include some descriptions.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/release/1.3.0/comment.png")}
  alt="Comment Block"
/>

### 3. Removal of Default Input and Output Initial Values

We noticed that many times, we do not need initial input and output values. Previously, this was a default behavior, leading to manual deletion each time a new block was created.

To improve the overall workflow, we will remove the initial input and output values starting from this version.

  src={useBaseUrl("/img/release/1.3.0/remove-input-output.png")}
  alt="Remove Default Input and Output Values"
/>

### 4. Upgrade of Save As Data Type Interaction

Developers designing blocks can specify the type of file suffix generated by users using `save_as`.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/release/1.3.0/save-as.png")}
  alt="Save As Interaction Upgrade"
/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/release/1.3.0/save-as-2.png")}
  alt="Save As Interaction Upgrade 2"
/>

### 5. Optimize Array Processing Efficiency

We received feedback from users that the array operations introduced in the previous version had a slow traversal efficiency. After some optimization, its performance has now improved by more than ten times, nearly reaching the efficiency of native traversal with minimal perceived delay.
