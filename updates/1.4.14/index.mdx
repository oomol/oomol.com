# OOMOL Studio

## General

### 1. Enhanced Community Experience

The Community feature has been rebuilt with native components instead of iframe, delivering a smoother and more responsive browsing and interaction experience.

### 2. New "Connect" Feature

Through built-in containers and network reverse proxy technology, we assign a domain name to your device, enabling you to use it like a server. For example, if you have a computer with an RTX 4090 GPU sitting idle at home, installing OOMOL Studio transforms it into a private cloud server, maximizing your hardware resources without purchasing additional servers.

### 3. Intelligent "Chat" Feature

Users can now use their created Blocks as AI Tool Calls. Through large language model integration, this feature lowers the barrier to entry, enables Block composition, and makes workflows more intelligent.

### 4. Convenient "Mini Apps" Feature

Users can utilize Blocks like forms—fill in parameters, execute, and wait for results. This feature is perfect when you know exactly what you need. Unlike the Chat feature, Mini Apps are designed for goal-oriented scenarios.

Mini Apps also support automation settings, allowing users to schedule timed executions for automated workflow runs.
